The Quiz-Game is a true or false game that consists of 10 questions. The program takes the user inputs 'true' or 'false' and determines if they are correct or incorrect.
The project consisted of using lists, dictionaries and object oriented programming. 
The project requirements are described below:
  1. Create a Question class that will consist of two attributes: the questions and respective answers. This will create a question object that is initialized with those two attributes.
  2. Create a database that consists of all the questions and correct answer using a list of dictionaries. The questions will be used to create a list of question objects using the Question model in Part 1. 
  3. Create a QuizBrain class with methods that controls the games. This will include going to the next question, check if there anymore questions, checking the user's input, and keeping score.
