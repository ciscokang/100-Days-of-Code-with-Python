# 100-Days-of-Code-with-Python
Hello World!

I decided to begin my journey as a self-taught developer by taking on the 100 days of code challenge. For assistance I am using Angela Yu's Udemy online course, 100 days of Code with Python, and will be uploading each project to the repository. 

DISCLAIMER: Majority of the projects included in this repository are based on similar code provided in the online course. However, it is important to note that rather than downloading the solution of the final code, I wrote my own code to ultimately practice and improve my skills as suggested in the course. Included in each project will be a README page describing what I had learned to document my progress, which I can also use in the future.
