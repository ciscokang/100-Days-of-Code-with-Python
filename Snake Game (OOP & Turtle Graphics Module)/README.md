This program is a re-make of the Snake Game using the object oriented programming and the turtle module in python.
This program incorporates class inheritance - define a class that inherits all the methods and attributes of another class. The turtle module is inherited in all the classes created for this project.
Project requirements:
  1. Set up the screen and create the initial snake body.
  2. Animate the snake segments on the screen.
  3. Create a snake class that includes methods to move the snake, extend the tail (upon detection with), respond to user keypresses, and reset snake.
  4. Detect collision with food.
  5. Move food after collision (Food class).
  6. Create a scoreboard and keep score (Scoreboard class).
  7. Detect collision with the wall or own tail.
